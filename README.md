🎨 AI Image Generator
An AI-powered image generator that creates stunning visuals from simple text prompts using deep learning.

🧠 Project Overview
This project allows users to generate images from text descriptions using advanced AI models like Stable Diffusion, DALL·E, or GANs. The main goal is to turn creative ideas into visuals instantly with the help of natural language processing and image synthesis.

🚀 Features
Generate high-quality images from text prompts

User-friendly interface (CLI or web-based)

Supports customization of image size and style

Optional: Save/download generated images

Optional: History of prompts used

🔧 Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript or React (if web-based)

Backend: Python (Flask / FastAPI)

Model: OpenAI DALL·E / Stable Diffusion / Custom GAN

Deployment: (Optional) Streamlit / Hugging Face / Render / Heroku

🛠️ Installation
bash

Edit
git clone https://github.com/Radhika-2005/ai-image-generator.git
cd ai-image-generator
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
💡 How It Works
User enters a text prompt (e.g., “A panda surfing on a watermelon”)

The model processes the prompt using a pretrained AI image generator

An image is generated and displayed to the user

📸 Sample Outputs
Prompt	Image
A futuristic city at sunset	
A cat in a space suit
